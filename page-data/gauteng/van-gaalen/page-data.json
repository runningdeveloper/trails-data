The farm has a number of routes which go next to and away from the river passing through the farm. It’s called the Van Gaalen Cheese farm because yes there is a small cheese making operation on site. There is a restaurant and farm stall where you can buy the cheese after a full hike.</p>\n<p>We took the river trail 12km which goes along the river and it has a number of reed forests and trees so you are not out in the sun all day which was nice.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 400px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/trails-data/static/3f4b000c50d5138ea96870d5c269b683/4b190/van-gaalen.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQBAwX/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAanFpJaM42//xAAbEAABBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIREgMEEP/aAAgBAQABBQJuxJvjV2KreEmf/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABH/2gAIAQMBAT8BiP/EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATAf/aAAgBAgEBPwGmqP/EABgQAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxARAy/9oACAEBAAY/AkM1Ar//xAAcEAEAAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABACExEVFhcYH/2gAIAQEAAT8hMhrxN5nZGJqZPkoxAUn/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAENTf/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABH/2gAIAQMBAT8QhD//xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARFR/9oACAECAQE/EIV8f//EABwQAAIDAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACFBYXGhsf/aAAgBAQABPxC6mIZNqBnQtgJRdzAB4C+RDpm3DgWGT//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"van gaalen cheese farm\"\n        title=\"van gaalen cheese farm\"\n        src=\"/trails-data/static/3f4b000c50d5138ea96870d5c269b683/066f9/van-gaalen.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/trails-data/static/3f4b000c50d5138ea96870d5c269b683/b9e9c/van-gaalen.jpg 100w,\n/trails-data/static/3f4b000c50d5138ea96870d5c269b683/e07e9/van-gaalen.jpg 200w,\n/trails-data/static/3f4b000c50d5138ea96870d5c269b683/066f9/van-gaalen.jpg 400w,\n/trails-data/static/3f4b000c50d5138ea96870d5c269b683/b4294/van-gaalen.jpg 600w,\n/trails-data/static/3f4b000c50d5138ea96870d5c269b683/4b190/van-gaalen.jpg 800w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>There is a parking lot with a guard.
