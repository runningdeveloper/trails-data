They do have a cafe on site for people visiting the park (incase you don’t bring any supplies). It is a bit pricey though, but has good stuff.</p>\n<p>If you want to have a day out with people that are not into walking, this is ideal as some of the group can walk around the park while others relax on a picnic blanket. They do have benches, chairs and spots to sit around the park.</p>\n<p>They are only open on the weekends from 10:00 - 16:00.\nIt wasn’t clear if dogs were allowed. There is adequate parking and you can pay with a card or cash at the entrance. There are toilets on site.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/nirox-sculpture-park/","province":"gauteng"},"frontmatter":{"trailName":"NIROX Sculpture Park","date":"9 October 2021","location":"https://goo.gl/maps/o8VSgXDH1hGTLEae9","routes":null,"link":"https://www.niroxarts.com/","activity":["walking"],"free":false}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/moreleta-kloof-nature-reserve/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/norscot-koppies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"eff676ba-75d5-5320-9efa-572145a7c010","previousPostId":"303872f2-cccd-52b9-9b2f-905c3db01939","nextPostId":"1792be85-de46-52fc-a40c-671c1bcf1574"}},
