There are a number of small lakes/dams in the park which attract a variety of birds. The Fourways Farmers market has moved here so if you there on the weekend you can visit the different stalls.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 400px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/trails-data/static/a26ea6b3495251dfb41146cdaf6d832e/4b190/taroko-trails.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"taroko trail park\"\n        title=\"taroko trail park\"\n        src=\"/trails-data/static/a26ea6b3495251dfb41146cdaf6d832e/066f9/taroko-trails.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/trails-data/static/a26ea6b3495251dfb41146cdaf6d832e/b9e9c/taroko-trails.jpg 100w,\n/trails-data/static/a26ea6b3495251dfb41146cdaf6d832e/e07e9/taroko-trails.jpg 200w,\n/trails-data/static/a26ea6b3495251dfb41146cdaf6d832e/066f9/taroko-trails.jpg 400w,\n/trails-data/static/a26ea6b3495251dfb41146cdaf6d832e/b4294/taroko-trails.jpg 600w,\n/trails-data/static/a26ea6b3495251dfb41146cdaf6d832e/4b190/taroko-trails.jpg 800w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>There are a number of cycling and hiking routes (trail running) to choose from with different difficulty levels. The routes were well marked with coloured arrows at each intersection or turn.</p>\n<p>We did the green mountain biking route which is 20km. There was a good mix of normal dirt roads, single track, forest and rocky sections. There was even a tiny bit of old tar road which is sometimes nice after bouncing around on a dirt track for a while. There were some nice fast bumpy downhill sections and a few small technical bits though the forest section.</p>\n<p>We were there on a weekday and it was empty, however with the farmers market and being located in Johannesburg I expect it to be busy on the weekends.</p>\n<p>The cost for cycling was R50. Hiking or running costs R30. This feels fair as it looks well maintained.</p>\n<p>There was a cycling shop and the trail pay station had refreshments you could buy.</p>\n<p>I will be going back to try a trail run.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/taroko-trails/","province":"gauteng"},"frontmatter":{"trailName":"Taroko Trail Park","date":"23 April 2021","location":"https://goo.gl/maps/1PrCFVB8ALNc6P3D7","routes":"https://www.strava.com/segments/27541060","link":"https://tarokotrails.co.za/","activity":["running","walking","cycling","hiking"],"free":false}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/robyn-park/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/van-gaalen/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b6ccba6d-be9e-5341-bb39-d55fa7ac55db","previousPostId":"e915c6fc-bca9-5524-82eb-bb893802cb2b","nextPostId":"2c703673-62bc-5591-b0dc-6816086fdd43"}},
