There is a guard at the gate to sign in and ample parking.</p>\n<p>After you’ve parked and walk into the reserve there is an amphitheatre with a large open area for you to relax and have a picnic, I saw a couple people chilling out in the sun. There are bathrooms and a couple thatched roofs for you to sit under if the sun gets hot.</p>\n<p>There are 4 routes ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 km. There is a trail for everyone here, simple, short and easy to a little harder and steeper. All of the trails I think are suitable for children and first timers. The tougher red route (Dassie) has some steep and rocky bits. The routes are well maintained with grass cut and obstacles removed.</p>\n<p>Look out for the dam and the wonderful views from the top of the hill. Also there is an old mine in the reserve but it’s closed off.</p>\n<p>No dogs allowed.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/kloofendal-nature-reserve/","province":"gauteng"},"frontmatter":{"trailName":"Kloofendal Nature Reserve","date":"23/10/2020","location":"https://goo.gl/maps/H7YVLVPmhrVnKhdi9","routes":"https://kloofendalfriends.yolasite.com/resources/Knd_Trails.jpg","link":"https://kloofendalfriends.yolasite.com/","activity":["running","walking","hiking"],"cost":"free"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/kings-kloof/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/western-cape/lions-head/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"53933f9f-bd47-51a0-8c64-e0d6eaac35d5","previousPostId":"9bfac51b-cc05-5a99-8941-ecb82f4c4e99","nextPostId":"80eeb5b7-a87b-50b5-a5fe-32c200e49ea7"}},
