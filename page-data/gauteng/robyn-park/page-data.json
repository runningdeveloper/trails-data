The bicycle ramps are still active.</p>\n<p>A busy family and dog walking spot which includes a wonderful short 3km mountain bike route in Douglasdale.

The community has also built some bicycle ramps which the kids (and me) seem to enjoy.</p>\n<p>Lots of dog walkers and there are security guards so it’s a safe place to go. It seems pretty well supported and maintained by the surrounding community.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/robyn-park/","province":"gauteng"},"frontmatter":{"trailName":"Robyn Park","date":"21 September 2021","location":"https://g.page/robyn-park-randburg?share","routes":["https://www.strava.com/segments/25214525"],"link":"https://www.strava.com/segments/25214525","activity":["running","walking","cycling"],"free":true,"otherLinks":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/rietfontein-ridge/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gauteng/sable-ranch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e915c6fc-bca9-5524-82eb-bb893802cb2b","previousPostId":"6f5c730c-56ac-5536-b711-5dab2338bcb1","nextPostId":"7ef5ea28-dfb7-55e6-bc02-a9c94f4f1875"}},
